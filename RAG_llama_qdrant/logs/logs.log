In this study, we\nexamined whether AR gene aberrations detectable in circulating\ncell-free DNA (cfDNA) are associated with resistance to abirater-\none acetate and enzalutamide in mCRPC patients', 'Experimental Design: Plasma was collected from 62 mCRPC\npatients ceasing abiraterone acetate (n ¼ 29), enzalutamide\n(n ¼ 19), or other agents (n ¼ 14) due to disease progression\n\nDNA was extracted and subjected to array comparative genomic\nhybridization (aCGH) for chromosome copy number analysis,\nand Roche 454 targeted next-generation sequencing of exon 8\nin the AR\n\nResults: On aCGH, AR ampliﬁcation was signiﬁcantly more\ncommon in patients progressing on enzalutamide than on abir-\naterone or other agents (53% vs. 17% vs. 21%, P ¼ 0.02, c2)', 'Missense AR exon 8 mutations were detected in 11 of 62 patients\n(18%), including the ﬁrst reported case of an F876L mutation in\nan enzalutamide-resistant patient and H874Y and T877A muta-\ntions in 7 abiraterone-resistant patients.

For data\nanalysis, raw reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19)\nusing BWA and visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer\n(IGV). Mutation frequency was quantiﬁed with SAMTOOLS. For\npositive controls, we used three prostate cancer cell lines [LNCaP\n(harbors T877A), 22rv1 (harbors H874Y), and LAPC4 (wild-type\nAR)]). DNA was extracted directly from these cell lines and\nprocessed through the same pipeline as patient samples (ampli-\nﬁcation, sequencing, mapping, and mutation calling). Matched\nwhite blood cell (WBC) DNA served as negative controls. On three\nrandom spots on the plate, we used blanks (water) to control for\ncontamination. Roche 454 technology is susceptible to speciﬁc\nartifacts (typically adjacent to homopolymer runs) that tend to be\npresent in all sequence libraries. To ﬁlter these artifacts, we\nexcluded variant calls that were detected in more than 75% of\nsequenced samples (this arbitrary ﬁlter could be varied signiﬁ-\ncantly with the same end result), since no true somatic mutation is\nlikely to exist at such high recurrence. For mutation calling, we set\na threshold of 12 nonreference reads, which was three times the\nmaximum nonreference frequency (i.e., noise) observed in WBC\nDNA samples. For samples with multiple mutations, we per-\nformed an estimation of haplotype frequency through careful\nmanual curation of aligned reads in IGV. Reads that had >7\nmismatches with reference sequence were considered uninforma-\ntive and were excluded. The remaining high conﬁdence reads were\ncounted and used for frequency estimation. To validate the 454\nresults, we resequenced AR exon 8 amplicons on the Illumina\nMiSeq platform.

In patients without detectable ctDNA, the median\nCTC count was 1 (IQR 0–3)', 'AR aberrations as predictive biomarkers in pretreatment cfDNA\nOf the 62 patients on study, 39 were switched from abiraterone\nor other systemic therapy onto enzalutamide after cfDNA collec-\ntion.

To identify predictive biomarkers in this\ncohort, genomic changes of the AR in pretreatment cfDNA and\nother baseline clinicopathological variables were correlated with\noutcomes on enzalutamide.

On univariate Cox\nproportional hazards regression analysis (Supplementary Table\nS5), the following factors were signiﬁcantly associated with PFS\non enzalutamide: presence of an AR gene aberration, AR copy\nnumber increase, prior docetaxel, visceral metastases, ECOG PS,\nserum ALP, and CTC count. Incorporating these variables into a\nmultivariate model (with the exception of AR copy number\nincrease), only an AR gene aberration in cfDNA remained a\nsigniﬁcant predictor of PFS (Supplementary Table S5)', 'Discussion\nIn this study, we identiﬁed widespread genomic aberrations in\ncfDNA from a large cohort of mCRPC patients progressing on\nsystemic therapy.

In our study,\nrobust detection of copy number changes was only possible in\npatients where tumor DNA was not heavily diluted. Although this\nrepresented the majority of our patients, in those samples with no\napparent copy number changes, it is not possible to distinguish\nbetween the absence of copy number changes in a patient's tumor,\nor insufﬁcient tumor DNA yield (although the burden of copy\nnumber changes in typical CRPC suggests the latter explanation\nmore likely). As demonstrated recently (7), this problem may be\novercome in patients by obtaining several temporal samples\n(maximizing the chance that at least one will contain tumor\nDNA), although this is not always feasible in late-stage disease", 'Nevertheless, even in the solitary samples obtained here, we\nobserved remarkable concordance to matched tissue biopsies\nwhere available, suggesting that cfDNA copy number analysis\nwill accurately inform on in situ disease in most patients. Mutation\nproﬁling provides a different challenge, since deep sequencing can\novercome dilution effects, but can be compromised by low-level\nplatform-speciﬁc noise. Use of two sequencing platforms with\ndifferent types of artifacts, as used in this study, can mitigate this\nconcern, and provide a level of validation. We drew additional\ncomfort from temporal sampling in two patients conﬁrming\nmutation presence, and the complete lack of synonymous muta-\ntions across the cohort, implying selection', 'A key ﬁnding of our study is that AR ampliﬁcations appeared to\nbe associated with resistance to enzalutamide. Although enzalu-\ntamide progressing patients were more heavily treated than abir-\naterone patients, we observed no signiﬁcant difference in the\ndetection rates of other copy number changes, suggesting that\nthe enrichment of AR ampliﬁcations in enzalutamide-resistant\npatients was not driven merely by tumor DNA yield. Similarly, the\nWCDT study reported that 4 of 6 (67%) enzalutamide-resistant\nbut only 1 of 11 (9%) abiraterone-resistant patients had AR\nampliﬁcation on FISH of metastatic tumor biopsies (6). Anec-\ndotal evidence also linked AR exon 8 mutations in cfDNA with\nenzalutamide resistance, as evidenced by the emergence of four\nnew mutations (including F876L) in a posttreatment sample\ncollected from a patient with rapid disease progression on enza-\nlutamide. This ﬁnding may reﬂect the presence of a mutation in\nmismatch repair genes such as MSH2 and MSH6, which were\nrecently linked to a hypermutated phenotype in CRPC patients\n(23)', 'Although AR ampliﬁcation did not appear to correlate with\nresistance to abiraterone, it is notable that all patients with an\nH874Y or T877A AR mutation were progressing on abiraterone or\nhad previously received abiraterone. In tumor biopsies from\nmCRPC patients, the emergence of progresterone-responsive\nT877A mutations was recently reported to be associated with\nabiraterone resistance (10). Together with our data, this impli-\ncates T877A mutations as a possible factor in the development of\nresistance to abiraterone. To the best of our knowledge there are\ncurrently no data linking H874Y mutations with abiraterone\nresistance; however, it is well recognized that this mutation\npromotes AR promiscuity and activation by antiandrogens, adre-\nnal androgens, and nonandrogenic steroids (24–26). In keeping\nwith this, two abiraterone-resistant patients with H874Y muta-\ntions subsequently had rapid disease progression on enzaluta-\nmide. This ﬁnding contradicts previous in vitro data suggesting\nthat enzalutamide maintains antitumor activity in H874Y-mutant\nprostate cancer cells (8)', 'The identiﬁcation of predictive biomarkers in mCRPC is critical\nto improving the clinical utility of currently available systemic\nagents. Importantly, our data indicate that AR gene aberrations\n(ampliﬁcation and/or exon 8 mutation) may be a predictive\nbiomarker for adverse outcomes in patients commencing enza-\nlutamide. We found that an AR gene aberration in pretreatment\ncfDNA was the only independent predictor of PFS and the only\nfactor associated with PSA decline \x0230% on enzalutamide. Sim-\nilarly, AR ampliﬁcation in cfDNA has been associated with lower\nresponse rates to abiraterone (7). Expression of AR splice variants\nin CTCs was also recently associated with primary resistance to\nabiraterone or enzalutamide (27) although AR ampliﬁcation was\nnot evaluated in this study, which may be signiﬁcant since full-\nlength AR is typically coexpressed with AR-V7 (28) and may be\nAR gene aberration\nA\nB\nNo AR gene aberration\nAR gene aberration\nNo\nYes\nNo-censored\nYes-censored\n100\n50\n0\nMaximum PSA change (%)\n–50\n–100\nDocetaxel\nAbiraterone\nProgression-free survival (months)\nCum. survival\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.00\n2.50\n5.00\n7.50\n10.00\n12.50\nFigure 4', 'A, waterfall plot of maximum % PSA change from baseline stratiﬁed by AR gene status.

With this in mind, real-time serial\nanalysis of circulating biomarkers, including cfDNA, could aid\noptimal therapy sequencing for individual patients', 'A priority for future cfDNA studies will be to conﬁrm the\nrelevance of AR aberrations using pre- and posttreatment samples\nobtained from a homogenous group of patients. This would\novercome key limitations of our study, which included collection\nof cfDNA at a single timepoint and recruitment of a heteroge-\nneous cohort with differing baseline characteristics and variable\nclinical follow-up. Furthermore, although AR exon 8 sequencing\nproved very informative here, it will be important to sequence the\nentire AR, especially in light of recent data suggesting that a L702H\nmutation can convert glucocorticoids to AR agonists (7). The\nspectrum of AR mutations, including the four novel mutations\nreported here, will need to be accurately functionalized to deter-\nmine their precise relevance to therapeutic resistance and disease\nprogression.
