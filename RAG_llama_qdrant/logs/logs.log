This resulted in Pokemon having three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures, representing producer Ishihara; and Nintendo, the publisher. Anne Allison (2006) wrote that Nintendo also bought Pokemon after it was finished.[113] Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) noted that the ownership structure of Pokemon is uncommon.[114] They wrote that "Pokemon is probably the only property in the world today for which the original rights are not concentrated in a single company", like The Walt Disney Company does with their IPs.[114] Tajiri and Ishihara did consider merging Game Freak and Creatures at one point. However, Tajiri decided against it because he feared it would erase what he had built up since he was a teenager. "I felt threatened by the idea of changing how Game Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr. Ishihara", he said. "It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased to exist, then so would I".

He believed that kids were being "brainwashed", and said: "I have had parents tell me that they cannot get their kids to do anything except Pokémon, so this stuff seems to really capture their minds, in a way".[5] These concerns were countered by psychologist William Damon, who told Newsweek that obsessing is in fact a normal part of a child\'s neurological development. It should concern parents only when the obsession gets dangerous or excessive.[510] An op-ed in the New Zealander newspaper The Dominion Post claimed that the anti-Pokémon sentiment was particularly American: "The backlash, which seems largely confined to the United States, may be no more than the sound of the world\'s leading cultural imperialist gagging on a taste of its own medicine".[511]'), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt'}, page_content='Pokémon refers to both the franchise itself and the creatures within its fictional universe.

Fiercely protective of Pokemon's brand equity, Ishihara was unwilling to greenlit an item just because it had a picture of a Pokemon printed on it. To avoid the market being flooded with low-quality goods, Ishihara put very specific demands on the products he evaluated.[163][201] Furthermore, in most cases, the council opted to contract one company for each product category.[202] Because of this, most merchandise proposals were rejected: of the approximately 7,500 applications submitted in 1997, only about 5% was approved.[203]"), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt'}, page_content='In Platinum, the developers focused on changing the most essential elements from Diamond and Pearl to maintain continuity with the previous games.

They approached this by designing the "Origin Forme" for the legendary Pokémon Giratina, ensuring that the design would appear significantly different from its regular form in Diamond and Pearl and to express the games\' core antimatter and Distortion World concepts.[374] The title Platinum was chosen to reflect a precious material that "shines" and is different from diamond and pearl and their associations of "love" and "happiness" respectively.[375]'), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt'}, page_content='4Kids, initially a little-known firm,[236][244] expanded thirty times in revenues,[312] and was named the fastest-growing company in America in the September 4, 2000 issue of Fortune magazine.[245][313][314] Many businesses that timely obtained a Pokémon license reaped considerable profits.[312][315] In the summer of 1999, a massive run on stocks of publicly traded Pokémon licensees caused their value to increase dramatically.

In the video games, each Pokemon has a specific cry. In Anakubo's CoroCoro manga, most Pokemon could speak. At first, the council believed there should be a mixture of Pokemon that could talk and Pokemon that could not. However, this idea was eventually discarded: the Pokemon had to make a specific cry. The council agreed that Pokemon were like animals, and while the humans and the Pokemon should be able to understand each other in the series, they should not speak each other's language.[183] It was decided that Pikachu would repeatedly say its own name in various intonations. The role of Pikachu was given to Ikue Otani. During try-outs, Yuyama had Otani voice Pikachu in normal Japanese, as well as in 'Pikachu talk', in which it only said the syllables of its name.

He thought the games were promising, but Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) had no plans at the time to release them elsewhere. He returned to America with a few cartridges and tested the game on his employees – they did not believe it would work in the US.[235] At the time, role-playing games (RPGs) were not very popular outside Japan,[236] and NoA executives believed that American children did not have the attention span for such a complex title.[237] Americans were said to be more interested in sport- and action-oriented games, preferably with realistic graphics.[11][238] Japanese people, by contrast, were alleged to care more about characters and plot.[239] Up to that point, few Japanese properties had been successfully mainstreamed in the US, and if they were, it was alleged to be on account of having been properly Americanized: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was considered a prime example of this.[240] Visually, Pokemon was believed to be too kawaii, or cute. It was assumed that Pokemon could not succeed on cute alone – it must also be cool.[241][242] In an effort to enhance the franchise\'s coolness, NoA considered a graphical redesign and contracted a few external artists to create some test-designs for the American market.[237][242] The mockups they proposed included \'graffiti style\' drawings,[242] \'beefed-up\' and more muscular looking Pokemon,[243] and a new Pikachu that looked like "a tiger with huge breasts".[241] Arakawa concluded that it "didn\'t work",[242] and by that time, the anime had begun its production in Japan, leading NoA to conclude it was too late for a graphical revamp anyway.[237]')]
