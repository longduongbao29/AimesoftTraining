In this study, we\nexamined whether AR gene aberrations detectable in circulating\ncell-free DNA (cfDNA) are associated with resistance to abirater-\none acetate and enzalutamide in mCRPC patients.\nExperimental Design: Plasma was collected from 62 mCRPC\npatients ceasing abiraterone acetate (n ¼ 29), enzalutamide\n(n ¼ 19), or other agents (n ¼ 14) due to disease progression.\nDNA was extracted and subjected to array comparative genomic\nhybridization (aCGH) for chromosome copy number analysis,\nand Roche 454 targeted next-generation sequencing of exon 8\nin the AR.\nResults: On aCGH, AR ampliﬁcation was signiﬁcantly more\ncommon in patients progressing on enzalutamide than on abir-\naterone or other agents (53% vs. 17% vs. 21%, P ¼ 0.02, c2).\nMissense AR exon 8 mutations were detected in 11 of 62 patients\n(18%), including the ﬁrst reported case of an F876L mutation in\nan enzalutamide-resistant patient and H874Y and T877A muta-\ntions in 7 abiraterone-resistant patients. In patients switched onto\nenzalutamide after cfDNA collection (n ¼ 39), an AR gene\naberration (copy number increase and/or an exon 8 mutation)\nin pretreatment cfDNA was associated with adverse outcomes,\nincluding lower rates of PSA decline \x02 30% (P ¼ 0.013, c2) and\nshorter time to radiographic/clinical progression (P ¼ 0.010, Cox\nproportional hazards regression).\nConclusions: AR gene aberrations in cfDNA are associated with\nresistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone in mCRPC.

This knowledge has underpinned the develop-\nment of novel agents targeting the androgen–AR axis, including\nabiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. Both agents have proven\nclinical efﬁcacy in mCRPC (2–5); however, disease progression on\ntreatment is inevitable and poses a major clinical challenge.\nAlthough incompletely understood, resistance to abiraterone and\nenzalutamide has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms,\nincluding reactivation of the androgen–AR axis via AR gene\naberrations such as AR ampliﬁcation and AR exon 8 mutations\n(6–10). A key barrier to better understanding mechanisms of\ntreatment resistance in mCRPC is the difﬁculty of obtaining\nbiopsies from bone and deep intra-abdominal lymph nodes, the\ncommonest sites of metastatic disease. Therefore, developing less\ninvasive means of sampling tumor material is essential for inves-\ntigating therapeutic resistance in mCRPC.\nIn recent years, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged\nas a promising and minimally invasive biomarker for proﬁling the\n1Vancouver Prostate Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n2Department of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency,\nVancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 3Helen Diller Family Compre-\nhensive Cancer Center, University of California at San Francisco, San\nFrancisco, California. 4Department of Urology, UCSF, UCSF Diller\nComprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, California. 5Depart-\nment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, OHSU Knight Cancer\nInstitute, Portland, Oregon. 6University of British Columbia, Vancou-\nver, British Columbia, Canada.\nNote: Supplementary data for this article are available at Clinical Cancer\nResearch Online (http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/).\nA.A.

An estimated 3% of tumor DNA is released\ninto the blood daily, most likely originating from apoptosis and\nnecrosis of cancer cells (12). Elevated levels of cfDNA have been\ndescribed in patients with malignancies, including prostate can-\ncer, being four to six times that of healthy controls (12). Impor-\ntantly, studies using targeted and whole-genome approaches in\nmetastatic prostate cancer patients have identiﬁed somatic geno-\nmic alterations in cfDNA, including ampliﬁcation (13) and muta-\ntions (7, 8). However, the utility of cfDNA for interrogating\nresistance mechanisms in mCRPC remains uncertain.\nWe hypothesized that AR gene aberrations, including ampliﬁ-\ncation and mutations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), are\ndetectable in cfDNA and would be associated with resistance to\nnovel therapies targeting the androgen–AR axis. Using plasma\nsamples collected from mCRPC patients progressing on systemic\ntherapy, including abiraterone and enzalutamide, the aim of this\nstudy was to elucidate possible mechanisms of treatment resis-\ntance through chromosome copy number analysis and AR exon 8\nsequencing of cfDNA.\nMaterials and Methods\nPatient cohort\nSixty-two patients with mCRPC were recruited at the British\nColumbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) - Vancouver Centre, Vancouver,\nCanada between August 2013 and March 2014. End-of-treatment\nsamples were collected from patients with evidence of biochem-\nical or radiologic progression (as deﬁned by Prostate Cancer\nWorking Group 2 criteria; ref. 14) or clinical progression [deﬁned\nas worsening disease-related symptoms necessitating a change in\nanticancer therapy and/or deterioration in Eastern Cooperative\nGroup Performance Status (ECOG PS) \x02 2 levels; ref. 15] on\nsystemic therapy for mCRPC. Thirty-nine of 62 (63%) patients\nwere switched onto enzalutamide after collection of cfDNA.\nClinicopathological characteristics, including prior and subse-\nquent therapies, were recorded for each patient. The University\nof British Columbia (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada)\nResearch Ethics Board approved this study and all patients pro-\nvided informed written consent.\nCollection and processing of peripheral blood samples\nFour EDTA tubes (6 mL each) of whole blood were collected per\npatient. Within 1 to 2 hours of collection, 150 mL of 10% buffered\nformalin was added to each tube. Plasma was removed after\ncentrifugation at 1,600 rpm at 4\x03C (2 \x04 10 minutes) and stored\nin 1-mL aliquots at \x0580\x03C.\nDNA extraction and quantiﬁcation\ncfDNA extraction, ampliﬁcation, sequencing, and analyses\nwere performed at the Vancouver Prostate Centre by investigators\nwho did not have access to clinical data and were blinded to\npatient outcome on therapy. DNA was isolated from plasma with\nthe Qiagen Circulating Nucleic Acids Kit (Cat No 55114), using 6\nmL of plasma per patient as per manufacturer\'s instructions. DNA\nquantiﬁcation was performed on a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life\nTechnologies) using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit according to the\nmanufacturer\'s instructions.\nArray comparative genomic hybridization of cfDNA\nPlasma DNA was ampliﬁed with the Sigma WGA2 kit (Cat No\nWGA2-10rxn or WGA2-50rxn) as per manufacturer\'s instructions.\nUp to 50 ng of sample DNA was ampliﬁed with an equal amount\nof normal reference DNA ampliﬁed concurrently. Following\nquantiﬁcation by the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer, 2.5 mg of\nWGA DNA was used as input for labeling for CGH (to control for\nWGA2-related artifacts). Samples and reference were labeled\nusing the NimbleGen method, which uses Cyanine dye labeled\nrandom nonamers (Cy5 for samples and Cy3 for reference) and\nKlenow 30-50exo-to enzymatically label and amplify the DNA.\nLabeled samples were puriﬁed by isopropanol precipitation, and\nquantiﬁed by the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Equal amounts\n(5 mg) of Cy5-sample and Cy3-reference were applied to Agilent\nCGH microarrays (Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Catalog CGH 8 \x04\n60 K, Design ID 021924), hybridized overnight at 65\x03C, washed,\nscanned with the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner, and quantiﬁed\nwith Agilent Feature Extraction software. Comparative genomic\nhybridization (CGH) data were visualized and analyzed using\nBiodiscovery Nexus 7 software, which includes the GISTIC algo-\nrithm. To account for dilution of tumor DNA with "normal"\ncirculating DNA, we relaxed the default thresholds for copy\nnumber calls to 0.1 and \x050.1 log2 (signal intensity of tumor vs.\nreference) for gain and loss, respectively. A log2 ratio of >1.2 was\ntermed high-level gain (i.e., ampliﬁcation). Raw array compara-\ntive genomic hybridization (aCGH) data are available at Gene\nExpression Omnibus accession number GSE61134 (16).\nAndrogen receptor exon 8 sequencing\nPCR was used to amplify a fragment of the AR (encompassing\nexon 8) using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB\nM0493L) and the following primers, which contain the relevant\nMID and fusion sequences necessary for the Roche 454 GS FLXþ\nsystem, software version 2.9: Forward (50 to 30) CCA TCT CAT\nCCC TGC GTG TCT CCG ACT CAG CGT GTC TCT ATC AAC CCT\nGTT TTT CTC CCT CTT ATT; Reverse (50 to 30) CCT ATC CCC TGT\nGTG CCT TGG CAG TCG AAA TAG GGT TTC CAA TGC TTC ACT.\nThe resulting 279 base-pair amplicons were run on an agarose gel\n(1.5%) and imaged. Normalization and pooling of each ampli-\ncon were accomplished by quantifying the ﬂuorescence intensities\nof each amplicon (from the gel) and adding the relative amount\n(in mL) needed to reach highest intensity. The separate pools were\nTranslational Relevance\nAnalysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a promising\nand minimally invasive approach for characterizing the tumor\ngenome in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer\n(mCRPC).

Aberrations in the AR (copy number increase and/or\nmutations) were observed in over half of our cohort, with AR\nampliﬁcation being linked to enzalutamide resistance. In\npatients who commenced enzalutamide following cfDNA\ncollection, detection of an AR gene aberration in pretreatment\ncfDNA was signiﬁcantly associated with lower PSA response\nrates and shorter time to progression. Our data collectively\nidentify AR aberrations in cfDNA as biomarkers linked to\ntreatment resistance and illustrate the potential for cfDNA to\nserve as a liquid biopsy in mCRPC patients.\nAzad et al.\nClin Cancer Res; 21(10) May 15, 2015\nClinical Cancer Research\n2316\nDownloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/21/10/2315/2023649/2315.pdf by Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. user on 12 May 2023\nthen subjected to AMPure (Agencourt A63881) clean-up to ensure\nno primers or nucleotides were carried into downstream work-\nﬂows. Each pool was processed through the Lib-L Roche 454\nemulsion PCR protocol and subsequently sequenced using the\nXLR70 sequencing kit as outlined by the manufacturer. For data\nanalysis, raw reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19)\nusing BWA and visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer\n(IGV). Mutation frequency was quantiﬁed with SAMTOOLS. For\npositive controls, we used three prostate cancer cell lines [LNCaP\n(harbors T877A), 22rv1 (harbors H874Y), and LAPC4 (wild-type\nAR)]). DNA was extracted directly from these cell lines and\nprocessed through the same pipeline as patient samples (ampli-\nﬁcation, sequencing, mapping, and mutation calling). Matched\nwhite blood cell (WBC) DNA served as negative controls. On three\nrandom spots on the plate, we used blanks (water) to control for\ncontamination. Roche 454 technology is susceptible to speciﬁc\nartifacts (typically adjacent to homopolymer runs) that tend to be\npresent in all sequence libraries. To ﬁlter these artifacts, we\nexcluded variant calls that were detected in more than 75% of\nsequenced samples (this arbitrary ﬁlter could be varied signiﬁ-\ncantly with the same end result), since no true somatic mutation is\nlikely to exist at such high recurrence. For mutation calling, we set\na threshold of 12 nonreference reads, which was three times the\nmaximum nonreference frequency (i.e., noise) observed in WBC\nDNA samples. For samples with multiple mutations, we per-\nformed an estimation of haplotype frequency through careful\nmanual curation of aligned reads in IGV. Reads that had >7\nmismatches with reference sequence were considered uninforma-\ntive and were excluded. The remaining high conﬁdence reads were\ncounted and used for frequency estimation. To validate the 454\nresults, we resequenced AR exon 8 amplicons on the Illumina\nMiSeq platform. An additional PCR was carried out to adapt these\namplicons to the Illumina MiSeq platform using the following\nprimers: Forward (50-30) TCG TCG GCA GCG TCA GAT GTG TAT\nAAG AGA CAG CCA TCT CAT CCC TGC GTG TCT CCG AC and\nReverse (50-30) GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG AGA TGT GTA TAA GAG\nACA GCC TAT CCC CTG TGT GCC TTG GCA GTC (the overlap\nwith the 454 primers is shown in bold). After adding index\nsequences to allow multiplexing of libraries and sequencing, the\nresulting amplicons were puriﬁed by AMPure (twice) and quan-\ntiﬁed via KAPA Library Quantiﬁcation Kit (cat# KK4835). The\nlibraries were then normalized to 2 nmol/L. Sequencing, using a\n500 cycle, 1M read kit (cat# MS-103-1003) was carried out as per\nmanufacturer\'s instructions.\nCirculating tumor cell enumeration\nCirculating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration was performed as\npreviously described (17). Seven and one-half milliliters of whole\nblood was collected in evacuated blood tubes (CellSave; Janssen),\nstored at room temperature for no more than 96 hours, and then\nprocessed as per manufacturer\'s instructions on the CellSearch\nSystem (Janssen). CTCs were deﬁned as nucleated cells expressing\ncytokeratin but not CD45.\nArray comparative genomic hybridization of tumor biopsies\nApproximately 50 cells were obtained from each biopsy sample\nthrough laser microdissection. Five microliters of cell extraction\nbuffer was pipetted onto the tissue to dislodge cells and then\ntransferred to a PCR tube. The cells were ampliﬁed using the\nPicoplex WGA kit (New England Biosciences) and the ampliﬁed\nproduct was puriﬁed using the QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation kit\n(Qiagen). The DNA concentration was quantiﬁed using Nano-\ndrop and the quality of DNA was veriﬁed by gel electrophoresis.\nOf note, 500 ng of ampliﬁed tumor sample was run on SurePrint\nG3 human CGH 8 \x04 60 K arrays (Agilent Technologies) along\nwith commercially available reference DNA (Promega) according\nto manufacturer\'s protocol. Feature Extraction and Cytogenomics\nsoftware (Agilent Technologies) was used to analyze and detect\ncopy number aberrations. To compare the copy number proﬁles\nof tumor biopsies and cfDNA, we calculated correlation coefﬁ-\ncients for every possible pair. Because normality could not be\nassumed, we then applied a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to determine\nwhether matched pairs differed from nonmatched.\nFISH of tumor biopsies\nFISH was performed with AR (Xq12) and X chromosome\ncentromere probes. Fifty interphase cells were scored. Cutoff for\nampliﬁcation: \x022.0.\nHuman cancer cell lines\nThe LNCaP cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Leland W.K.\nChung (1992, MDACC, Houston TX) and tested and authenti-\ncated by whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing in\nJuly 2009. 22Rv1 cells were originally obtained from ATCC (2008\nand 1989, ATCC authentication by isoenzymes analysis). During\nthe course of our study, each cell line was also authenticated using\naCGH.\nStatistical analysis\nFrequency of copy number changes and AR exon 8 mutations in\nend-of-treatment samples were compared between patients pro-\ngressing on abiraterone, enzalutamide, or other agents using c2\ntest. In patients switched onto enzalutamide after cfDNA collec-\ntion, univariate analysis was performed to identify variables\nassociated with PSA response (c2 for categorical variables or\nlogistic regression for continuous variables) and clinical and/or\nradiographic progression-free survival (PFS; Cox proportional-\nhazards modeling). Multivariate analysis of PFS was performed\nusing factors that were signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) on univariate\nanalysis.\nResults\nPatient cohort\nPlasma was collected from 62 mCRPC patients with evidence of\ndisease progression on abiraterone (n ¼ 29), enzalutamide (n ¼\n19), or other systemic agents (n ¼ 14). A summary of patient\ncharacteristics at collection of cfDNA is presented in Table 1.\nMedian time from diagnosis of CRPC to cfDNA collection was\n28.3 months [interquartile range (IQR) range: 16.3–40.9].\nPatients had been treated with a median of three lines of systemic\ntherapy (range: 1–8) beyond LHRH antagonists/agonists. Mean\nand median DNA concentration was 6.38 ng/mL and 1.47 ng/mL,\nrespectively (IQR range: 0.9–4.0).\nAR gene ampliﬁcation in cfDNA associated with treatment\nresistance\nWe used aCGH to proﬁle the genome copy number of all 62\ncfDNA samples (Supplementary Table S1).

Other copy number varia-\ntions included copy number increase of CCND1, CCNE1, MYC,\nand MET (Fig. 1C), which were present in 16% (10/62), 10%\n(6/62), 39% (24/62), and 16% (10/62) of patients, respectively.\nAlthough AR copy number gain is rarely present in hormone-\nna€\n\x02ve primary disease, elevated AR gene copy levels in CRPC are a\ncommon aberration linked to disease progression (21). Reassur-\ningly therefore, focal AR copy number increase in cfDNA was\nhighly signiﬁcant by GISTIC analysis across the patient cohort (Q-\nbound signiﬁcance ¼ 3.36E-6; G-score ¼ 11.941). However, the\nfrequency of AR ampliﬁcation was signiﬁcantly higher in patients\nprogressing on enzalutamide than patients progressing on abir-\naterone or other agents (53% vs. 17% vs. 21%, P ¼ 0.02; c2;\nSupplementary Table S2). This was in contrast with the frequency\nof other prostate cancer-associated copy number changes (e.g., 8q\ngain), which showed no signiﬁcant difference between treatment\ngroups. Furthermore, median cfDNA concentration exhibited\nonly minimal variation between patients progressing on abirater-\none (1.64 ng/mL; IQR 1–3.46) and enzalutamide (1.77 ng/mL; IQR\n0.98–4.85). Although 16 of 19 patients progressing on enzalu-\ntamide had previously received abiraterone, these data point to\nAR\nampliﬁcation\nas\na\nkey\nmechanism\nof\nresistance\nto\nenzalutamide.\nTo determine whether cfDNA data (generated inherently from\n"dead" cells) are representative of actual metastases, we analyzed\nmatched metastatic tumor biopsies collected from 7 patients\nenrolled on the SU2C/PCF/AACR West Coast Prostate Cancer\nDream Team study (WCDT). All 5 patients with AR ampliﬁcation\nin cfDNA had AR ampliﬁcation detected by FISH on tumor tissue.\nThe remaining 2 patients had single copy gain of AR in cfDNA and\nas expected, neither had AR ampliﬁcation present on FISH. For 5\nof these 7 patients, we performed additional copy number pro-\nﬁling of tumor biopsies using aCGH. Notably, matched pairs\n(cfDNA and biopsy from the same patient) were signiﬁcantly\nmore correlated than nonmatched pairs (P ¼ 3.764e-05; Wil-\ncoxon rank-sum test) and AR status was completely concordant\nacross all 5 samples (Supplementary Fig. S1). Two patients, VC-\n008 and VC-013, had CCND1 and MYC ampliﬁcation, respec-\ntively, in their cfDNA and both ampliﬁcations were detectable in\ntheir matched tumor biopsy (Supplementary Fig. S1). A third\npatient (VC-051) had CCNE1 ampliﬁcation in cfDNA that was\nnot detectable in his biopsy (despite similar copy number proﬁles\noverall), possibly reﬂecting tumor heterogeneity and highlighting\nrecognized sampling limitation of biopsies.\nDeep sequencing reveals AR mutations in cfDNA\nMutations of the LBD of the AR can modulate ligand and\ncofactor afﬁnity, and result in gain-of-function through increased\nsensitivity to other steroid ligands (e.g., progesterone, adrenal\nandrogens) or the conversion of direct inhibitors (e.g., bicalu-\ntamide) into agonists (22). Although primary prostate tumors\nseldom demonstrate AR mutations (7), they are found in 10% to\n20% of patients with late-stage CRPC (19, 20), most commonly\nin the LBD (22). Several of these mutations are localized to exon\n8 in the AR, including H874Y, T877A, and F876L, which have\nbeen linked to enzalutamide resistance in vitro and was detected\nin cfDNA from 3 of 27 prostate cancer patients progressing on\nthe novel AR antagonist ARN-509 using PCR-based BEAMing\ntechnology (8, 9). We hypothesized that mutations in exon 8 of\nthe AR may contribute to resistance in a subset of our patients\nprogressing on enzalutamide or abiraterone and would be\ndetectable in their cfDNA at progression. Given the low quantity\nof cfDNA and the high "dilution" with normal circulating DNA,\nwe adopted a targeted approach using Roche 454 technology to\nprovide deep sequencing coverage (>10,000X) across the coding\nregion of AR exon 8 (52 codons). Unlike aCGH, DNA was not\nampliﬁed for the purposes of sequencing. Samples from 14 of 62\npatients were not amenable to sequencing due to low DNA\nquantity or concentration.\nTo ensure integrity of our sequencing data, several different\ncontrols were used, including water blanks (which produced < 5\nreads), seven matched WBC DNA samples (which had a maxi-\nmum of four nonreference reads at any base), and three prostate\nTable 1.

Importantly,\nexpected mutations were detected at 100% frequency in 22RV1\n(H874Y) and LNCaP (T877A) cells, whereas no mutations were\nfound in AR wild-type LAPC4 cells. A threshold of 12 nonrefer-\nence reads was set for calling mutations as this was three times the\nmaximum nonreference frequency (i.e., noise) observed in WBC\nDNA samples.\nIn total, six different base changes in the coding region of exon 8\nwere robustly detected in 11 of 62 (18%) patients (Table 2).\nFurther underlining the validity of results, all six changes result in\nan amino acid substitution: H874Y (n ¼ 5), T877A (n ¼ 2),\nD879E, L881I, E893K, and M895V (all n ¼ 1; Fig. 2A). Mutation\nfrequency in cfDNA ranged from 0.09% to 17.75%, likely reﬂect-\ning the signiﬁcant dilution effect of nontumor DNA. Of note, AR\nexon 8 mutations were mutually exclusive with AR copy number\nincrease in 8 of 11 (73%) patients, whereas three of the mutations\ndetected (D879E, L881I and E893K) have not been previously\nidentiﬁed in patients with prostate cancer. In contrast with AR\ncopy number gain described above, the incidence of mutations\nwas not signiﬁcantly different between patients progressing on\nabiraterone (7/29), enzalutamide (3/19), or other agents (1/14;\nP ¼ 0.38; c2). However, all 7 patients with H874Y or T877A\nFigure 1.\nCopy number analysis of cfDNA. A, a pile-up of the aCGH results from all patients showing gains (blue) and losses (red).

All tested mutations were redetected, with the\nexception of two that had very low frequency in the discovery\nrun (Table 2). To further validate mutation ﬁndings, we\nobtained a second cfDNA sample from 2 patients (VC-012\nand VC-041), this time at progression on enzalutamide (the\nﬁrst cfDNA sample was collected at progression on abiraterone\nbefore commencing enzalutamide). Reassuringly, the initial\nmutations were redetected for both patients using Roche 454\nsequencing (Table 2). For VC-012, four additional mutations\narose in the second sample, including F876L (the ﬁrst instance\nof this mutation being detected in an enzalutamide-resistant\npatient) and S888G (not previously reported in patients with\nprostate cancer). Interestingly, although ﬁve total mutations\nwere found in the second sample from VC-012, no sequencing\nread contained more than two mutations simultaneously (Fig.\n2B). Manual curation of high quality reads suggested that there\nwere six different AR gene variants, likely reﬂecting diverse\nintra-patient AR heterogeneity. Of note, VC-012 experienced\nrapid disease progression (2.3 months) on enzalutamide.\nIntegrated copy number and AR mutation proﬁle of cfDNA\nA summary of copy number changes and AR exon 8 muta-\ntions detectable in cfDNA for each patient is presented in Fig. 3.\nOverall, 40 of 62 (65%) patients had a prostate cancer-asso-\nciated copy number change and/or an AR exon 8 mutation\npresent in cfDNA, strongly implying the presence of tumor-\nTable 2.

AR gene aberrations (copy number increase\nand/or mutation) were observed in 36 of 62 (58%) patients.\nClinicopathological factors signiﬁcantly associated with the\npresence of tumor-derived cfDNA included treatment with any\nof docetaxel, abiraterone, or enzalutamide, serum ALP > 160\nIU/L and CTC count \x02 5 cells/7.5 mL blood (Supplementary\nTable S3). In patients without detectable ctDNA, the median\nCTC count was 1 (IQR 0–3).\nAR aberrations as predictive biomarkers in pretreatment cfDNA\nOf the 62 patients on study, 39 were switched from abiraterone\nor other systemic therapy onto enzalutamide after cfDNA collec-\ntion. Of these patients, 19 of 39 (49%) possessed an AR gene\naberration in cfDNA, including 14 with copy number increase and\n5 with the following mutations: H874Y (n ¼ 2), E893K, M895V,\nand T877A (all n ¼ 1). To identify predictive biomarkers in this\ncohort, genomic changes of the AR in pretreatment cfDNA and\nother baseline clinicopathological variables were correlated with\noutcomes on enzalutamide. As shown in SupplementaryTable S4,\nan AR gene aberration in pretreatment cfDNA was signiﬁcantly\nassociated with lower rates of PSA decline \x02 30% (21% vs. 60%;\nP ¼ 0.013) on enzalutamide with a strong trend toward signif-\nicance for PSA decline \x0250% (21% vs. 50%; P ¼ 0.06). No other\nvariables were signiﬁcantly associated with PSA decline \x02 30% or\n\x0250%. The PSA waterfall plot stratiﬁed by AR gene status is shown\nin Fig. 4A.\nIn patients with and without an AR gene aberration, median\nclinical/radiographic PFS was 2.3 months (95% conﬁdence inter-\nvals; CI, 1.6–3.1) versus 7.0 months (95% CI, 2.7–11.3), respec-\ntively (P < 0.001, log-rank) on Kaplan–Meier analysis (Fig. 4B).\nSigniﬁcantly, although H874Y-mutated prostate cancer cells are\nsensitive to enzalutamide in vitro (8), both patients with an H874Y\nmutation in pretreatment cfDNA progressed rapidly on enzalu-\ntamide (2.4 and 2.9 months, respectively). On univariate Cox\nproportional hazards regression analysis (Supplementary Table\nS5), the following factors were signiﬁcantly associated with PFS\non enzalutamide: presence of an AR gene aberration, AR copy\nnumber increase, prior docetaxel, visceral metastases, ECOG PS,\nserum ALP, and CTC count. Incorporating these variables into a\nmultivariate model (with the exception of AR copy number\nincrease), only an AR gene aberration in cfDNA remained a\nsigniﬁcant predictor of PFS (Supplementary Table S5).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we identiﬁed widespread genomic aberrations in\ncfDNA from a large cohort of mCRPC patients progressing on\nsystemic therapy. Over half of our cohort had an AR gene aber-\nration, with enzalutamide resistance linked to AR ampliﬁcation.\nLikewise, in a cohort of patients switched onto enzalutamide after\ncfDNA collection, the presence of pretreatment AR gene aberra-\ntions was predictive for adverse clinical outcomes.\nThe interrogation of cfDNA shows great promise for advancing\nprecision oncology, particularly in prostate cancer where tissue\nbiopsies are logistically challenging. However, the low overall\nyield and variable dilution of tumor DNA with "normal" DNA\nFigure 3.\nIntegrated copy number and AR exon\n8 mutation data in cfDNA for 62\npatients on study.

In our study,\nrobust detection of copy number changes was only possible in\npatients where tumor DNA was not heavily diluted. Although this\nrepresented the majority of our patients, in those samples with no\napparent copy number changes, it is not possible to distinguish\nbetween the absence of copy number changes in a patient\'s tumor,\nor insufﬁcient tumor DNA yield (although the burden of copy\nnumber changes in typical CRPC suggests the latter explanation\nmore likely). As demonstrated recently (7), this problem may be\novercome in patients by obtaining several temporal samples\n(maximizing the chance that at least one will contain tumor\nDNA), although this is not always feasible in late-stage disease.\nNevertheless, even in the solitary samples obtained here, we\nobserved remarkable concordance to matched tissue biopsies\nwhere available, suggesting that cfDNA copy number analysis\nwill accurately inform on in situ disease in most patients. Mutation\nproﬁling provides a different challenge, since deep sequencing can\novercome dilution effects, but can be compromised by low-level\nplatform-speciﬁc noise. Use of two sequencing platforms with\ndifferent types of artifacts, as used in this study, can mitigate this\nconcern, and provide a level of validation. We drew additional\ncomfort from temporal sampling in two patients conﬁrming\nmutation presence, and the complete lack of synonymous muta-\ntions across the cohort, implying selection.\nA key ﬁnding of our study is that AR ampliﬁcations appeared to\nbe associated with resistance to enzalutamide. Although enzalu-\ntamide progressing patients were more heavily treated than abir-\naterone patients, we observed no signiﬁcant difference in the\ndetection rates of other copy number changes, suggesting that\nthe enrichment of AR ampliﬁcations in enzalutamide-resistant\npatients was not driven merely by tumor DNA yield. Similarly, the\nWCDT study reported that 4 of 6 (67%) enzalutamide-resistant\nbut only 1 of 11 (9%) abiraterone-resistant patients had AR\nampliﬁcation on FISH of metastatic tumor biopsies (6). Anec-\ndotal evidence also linked AR exon 8 mutations in cfDNA with\nenzalutamide resistance, as evidenced by the emergence of four\nnew mutations (including F876L) in a posttreatment sample\ncollected from a patient with rapid disease progression on enza-\nlutamide. This ﬁnding may reﬂect the presence of a mutation in\nmismatch repair genes such as MSH2 and MSH6, which were\nrecently linked to a hypermutated phenotype in CRPC patients\n(23).\nAlthough AR ampliﬁcation did not appear to correlate with\nresistance to abiraterone, it is notable that all patients with an\nH874Y or T877A AR mutation were progressing on abiraterone or\nhad previously received abiraterone. In tumor biopsies from\nmCRPC patients, the emergence of progresterone-responsive\nT877A mutations was recently reported to be associated with\nabiraterone resistance (10). Together with our data, this impli-\ncates T877A mutations as a possible factor in the development of\nresistance to abiraterone. To the best of our knowledge there are\ncurrently no data linking H874Y mutations with abiraterone\nresistance; however, it is well recognized that this mutation\npromotes AR promiscuity and activation by antiandrogens, adre-\nnal androgens, and nonandrogenic steroids (24–26). In keeping\nwith this, two abiraterone-resistant patients with H874Y muta-\ntions subsequently had rapid disease progression on enzaluta-\nmide. This ﬁnding contradicts previous in vitro data suggesting\nthat enzalutamide maintains antitumor activity in H874Y-mutant\nprostate cancer cells (8).\nThe identiﬁcation of predictive biomarkers in mCRPC is critical\nto improving the clinical utility of currently available systemic\nagents. Importantly, our data indicate that AR gene aberrations\n(ampliﬁcation and/or exon 8 mutation) may be a predictive\nbiomarker for adverse outcomes in patients commencing enza-\nlutamide. We found that an AR gene aberration in pretreatment\ncfDNA was the only independent predictor of PFS and the only\nfactor associated with PSA decline \x0230% on enzalutamide. Sim-\nilarly, AR ampliﬁcation in cfDNA has been associated with lower\nresponse rates to abiraterone (7). Expression of AR splice variants\nin CTCs was also recently associated with primary resistance to\nabiraterone or enzalutamide (27) although AR ampliﬁcation was\nnot evaluated in this study, which may be signiﬁcant since full-\nlength AR is typically coexpressed with AR-V7 (28) and may be\nAR gene aberration\nA\nB\nNo AR gene aberration\nAR gene aberration\nNo\nYes\nNo-censored\nYes-censored\n100\n50\n0\nMaximum PSA change (%)\n–50\n–100\nDocetaxel\nAbiraterone\nProgression-free survival (months)\nCum. survival\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.00\n2.50\n5.00\n7.50\n10.00\n12.50\nFigure 4.\nA, waterfall plot of maximum % PSA change from baseline stratiﬁed by AR gene status.

With this in mind, real-time serial\nanalysis of circulating biomarkers, including cfDNA, could aid\noptimal therapy sequencing for individual patients.\nA priority for future cfDNA studies will be to conﬁrm the\nrelevance of AR aberrations using pre- and posttreatment samples\nobtained from a homogenous group of patients. This would\novercome key limitations of our study, which included collection\nof cfDNA at a single timepoint and recruitment of a heteroge-\nneous cohort with differing baseline characteristics and variable\nclinical follow-up. Furthermore, although AR exon 8 sequencing\nproved very informative here, it will be important to sequence the\nentire AR, especially in light of recent data suggesting that a L702H\nmutation can convert glucocorticoids to AR agonists (7). The\nspectrum of AR mutations, including the four novel mutations\nreported here, will need to be accurately functionalized to deter-\nmine their precise relevance to therapeutic resistance and disease\nprogression. Finally, other genomic aberrations identiﬁed in our\nstudy, such as CCND1 ampliﬁcation (potentially sensitizing to\nCDK4/6 blockade; ref. 38), may serve as predictive factors guiding\ntreatment selection and warrant further exploration.\nDisclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of Interest\nK.N.

In this study, we\nexamined whether AR gene aberrations detectable in circulating\ncell-free DNA (cfDNA) are associated with resistance to abirater-\none acetate and enzalutamide in mCRPC patients', 'Experimental Design: Plasma was collected from 62 mCRPC\npatients ceasing abiraterone acetate (n ¼ 29), enzalutamide\n(n ¼ 19), or other agents (n ¼ 14) due to disease progression\n\nDNA was extracted and subjected to array comparative genomic\nhybridization (aCGH) for chromosome copy number analysis,\nand Roche 454 targeted next-generation sequencing of exon 8\nin the AR\n\nResults: On aCGH, AR ampliﬁcation was signiﬁcantly more\ncommon in patients progressing on enzalutamide than on abir-\naterone or other agents (53% vs. 17% vs. 21%, P ¼ 0.02, c2)', 'Missense AR exon 8 mutations were detected in 11 of 62 patients\n(18%), including the ﬁrst reported case of an F876L mutation in\nan enzalutamide-resistant patient and H874Y and T877A muta-\ntions in 7 abiraterone-resistant patients.

For data\nanalysis, raw reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19)\nusing BWA and visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer\n(IGV). Mutation frequency was quantiﬁed with SAMTOOLS. For\npositive controls, we used three prostate cancer cell lines [LNCaP\n(harbors T877A), 22rv1 (harbors H874Y), and LAPC4 (wild-type\nAR)]). DNA was extracted directly from these cell lines and\nprocessed through the same pipeline as patient samples (ampli-\nﬁcation, sequencing, mapping, and mutation calling). Matched\nwhite blood cell (WBC) DNA served as negative controls. On three\nrandom spots on the plate, we used blanks (water) to control for\ncontamination. Roche 454 technology is susceptible to speciﬁc\nartifacts (typically adjacent to homopolymer runs) that tend to be\npresent in all sequence libraries. To ﬁlter these artifacts, we\nexcluded variant calls that were detected in more than 75% of\nsequenced samples (this arbitrary ﬁlter could be varied signiﬁ-\ncantly with the same end result), since no true somatic mutation is\nlikely to exist at such high recurrence. For mutation calling, we set\na threshold of 12 nonreference reads, which was three times the\nmaximum nonreference frequency (i.e., noise) observed in WBC\nDNA samples. For samples with multiple mutations, we per-\nformed an estimation of haplotype frequency through careful\nmanual curation of aligned reads in IGV. Reads that had >7\nmismatches with reference sequence were considered uninforma-\ntive and were excluded. The remaining high conﬁdence reads were\ncounted and used for frequency estimation. To validate the 454\nresults, we resequenced AR exon 8 amplicons on the Illumina\nMiSeq platform.

In our study,\nrobust detection of copy number changes was only possible in\npatients where tumor DNA was not heavily diluted. Although this\nrepresented the majority of our patients, in those samples with no\napparent copy number changes, it is not possible to distinguish\nbetween the absence of copy number changes in a patient's tumor,\nor insufﬁcient tumor DNA yield (although the burden of copy\nnumber changes in typical CRPC suggests the latter explanation\nmore likely). As demonstrated recently (7), this problem may be\novercome in patients by obtaining several temporal samples\n(maximizing the chance that at least one will contain tumor\nDNA), although this is not always feasible in late-stage disease", 'Nevertheless, even in the solitary samples obtained here, we\nobserved remarkable concordance to matched tissue biopsies\nwhere available, suggesting that cfDNA copy number analysis\nwill accurately inform on in situ disease in most patients. Mutation\nproﬁling provides a different challenge, since deep sequencing can\novercome dilution effects, but can be compromised by low-level\nplatform-speciﬁc noise. Use of two sequencing platforms with\ndifferent types of artifacts, as used in this study, can mitigate this\nconcern, and provide a level of validation. We drew additional\ncomfort from temporal sampling in two patients conﬁrming\nmutation presence, and the complete lack of synonymous muta-\ntions across the cohort, implying selection', 'A key ﬁnding of our study is that AR ampliﬁcations appeared to\nbe associated with resistance to enzalutamide. Although enzalu-\ntamide progressing patients were more heavily treated than abir-\naterone patients, we observed no signiﬁcant difference in the\ndetection rates of other copy number changes, suggesting that\nthe enrichment of AR ampliﬁcations in enzalutamide-resistant\npatients was not driven merely by tumor DNA yield. Similarly, the\nWCDT study reported that 4 of 6 (67%) enzalutamide-resistant\nbut only 1 of 11 (9%) abiraterone-resistant patients had AR\nampliﬁcation on FISH of metastatic tumor biopsies (6). Anec-\ndotal evidence also linked AR exon 8 mutations in cfDNA with\nenzalutamide resistance, as evidenced by the emergence of four\nnew mutations (including F876L) in a posttreatment sample\ncollected from a patient with rapid disease progression on enza-\nlutamide. This ﬁnding may reﬂect the presence of a mutation in\nmismatch repair genes such as MSH2 and MSH6, which were\nrecently linked to a hypermutated phenotype in CRPC patients\n(23)', 'Although AR ampliﬁcation did not appear to correlate with\nresistance to abiraterone, it is notable that all patients with an\nH874Y or T877A AR mutation were progressing on abiraterone or\nhad previously received abiraterone. In tumor biopsies from\nmCRPC patients, the emergence of progresterone-responsive\nT877A mutations was recently reported to be associated with\nabiraterone resistance (10). Together with our data, this impli-\ncates T877A mutations as a possible factor in the development of\nresistance to abiraterone. To the best of our knowledge there are\ncurrently no data linking H874Y mutations with abiraterone\nresistance; however, it is well recognized that this mutation\npromotes AR promiscuity and activation by antiandrogens, adre-\nnal androgens, and nonandrogenic steroids (24–26). In keeping\nwith this, two abiraterone-resistant patients with H874Y muta-\ntions subsequently had rapid disease progression on enzaluta-\nmide. This ﬁnding contradicts previous in vitro data suggesting\nthat enzalutamide maintains antitumor activity in H874Y-mutant\nprostate cancer cells (8)', 'The identiﬁcation of predictive biomarkers in mCRPC is critical\nto improving the clinical utility of currently available systemic\nagents. Importantly, our data indicate that AR gene aberrations\n(ampliﬁcation and/or exon 8 mutation) may be a predictive\nbiomarker for adverse outcomes in patients commencing enza-\nlutamide. We found that an AR gene aberration in pretreatment\ncfDNA was the only independent predictor of PFS and the only\nfactor associated with PSA decline \x0230% on enzalutamide. Sim-\nilarly, AR ampliﬁcation in cfDNA has been associated with lower\nresponse rates to abiraterone (7). Expression of AR splice variants\nin CTCs was also recently associated with primary resistance to\nabiraterone or enzalutamide (27) although AR ampliﬁcation was\nnot evaluated in this study, which may be signiﬁcant since full-\nlength AR is typically coexpressed with AR-V7 (28) and may be\nAR gene aberration\nA\nB\nNo AR gene aberration\nAR gene aberration\nNo\nYes\nNo-censored\nYes-censored\n100\n50\n0\nMaximum PSA change (%)\n–50\n–100\nDocetaxel\nAbiraterone\nProgression-free survival (months)\nCum. survival\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.00\n2.50\n5.00\n7.50\n10.00\n12.50\nFigure 4', 'A, waterfall plot of maximum % PSA change from baseline stratiﬁed by AR gene status.
